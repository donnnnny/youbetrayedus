    <h2>Why we're leaving Heroku</h2>
    <p>
        Fight for the Future has published this open letter to the CEO of Salesforce
        and Heroku following their
        <a href="http://www.bsa.org/~/media/Files/Policy/data/09142015CongLeadershipDataAgendaLetter.pdf" target="_blank">endorsement of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act</a> (CISA).
        We urge others to join us in boycotting Heroku and any other  hosting service that supports
        mass surveillance legislation.
    </p>
    <p>To sign onto our boycott, please email <a href="mailto:team@fightforthefuture.org">team@fightforthefuture.org</a></p>
    <h3>What's wrong with CISA?</h3>
    <p>
        If you’re not up to speed, CISA is a mass surveillance bill posing as a
        “cybersecurity” bill. Congress has been blindly scrambling to react to the
        OPM hacks, and their solution is a giveaway to the NSA and giant corporations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            All privacy policies effectively null and void. Companies can share any
            private user data with the government, without a warrant, as long as
            the government says it is being used for a “cybersecurity” purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            Data is shared with a wide array of government agencies, from the FBI
            and NSA, to the IRS and local law enforcement.
        </li>
        <li>
            In exchange, companies are given blanket immunity from civil and criminal
            laws, like fraud, money laundering, or illegal wiretapping (if a
            violation was committed or exposed in the process of sharing data).
        </li>
        <li>
            Companies that play along can get otherwise classified intelligence data
            from the government, including private information about their competitors.
        </li>
    </ul>
