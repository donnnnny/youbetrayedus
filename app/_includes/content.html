    <h2>These companies are cowards.</h2>
    <p>
        What does it take for some of the biggest competitors in the tech industry
        to put their differences aside and sign a letter endorsing a hugely unpopular
        bill? Cowardice. These companies know that their customers hate CISA,
        and so they’re jumping into the water together, hoping there’s power in
        numbers. After all, you can’t blame Microsoft if Apple is doing the same thing, right?
    </p>
    <h3>What's wrong with CISA?</h3>
    <p>
        If you’re not up to speed, CISA is a mass surveillance bill posing as a
        “cybersecurity” bill. Congress has been blindly scrambling to react to the
        OPM hacks, and their solution is a giveaway to the NSA and giant corporations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            All privacy policies effectively null and void. Companies can share any
            private user data with the government, without a warrant, as long as
            the government says it is being used for a “cybersecurity” purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            In exchange, companies are given blanket immunity from civil and criminal
            laws, like fraud, money laundering, or illegal wiretapping (if a
            violation was committed or exposed in the process of sharing data).
        </li>
        <li>
            Companies that play along can get otherwise classified intelligence data
            from the government, including private information about their competitors.
        </li>
    </ul>
