    <h1>The following companies just betrayed billions of people.</h1>
    <p>
        Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, Symantec, and a handful of other tech companies
        just began publicly lobbying Congress to pass the Cybersecurity Information
        Sharing Act (CISA), a bill that would give corporations total legal immunity
        when they share private user data with the government and with each other.
        Many of these companies have previously claimed to fight for their users'
        privacy rights, but by supporting this bill they've made it clear that
        they've abandoned that position, and are willing to endanger their users'
        security and civil rights in exchange for government handouts and protection.

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>Tell them why they're on the wrong side of history.</h3>
        <div id="petition">By supporting CISA, you are betraying your customers and selling out freedom on the Internet to a government obsessed with control. It's pathetic that you want legal immunity for violating your own privacy agreements with customers. Shame on you.</div>
