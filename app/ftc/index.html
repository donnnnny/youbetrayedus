        "Cyber attacks" would stop very quickly if the FTC actually held companies accountable.
    </h1>
    <p>
        When T-Mobile and Experian leaked 15 million customer records to identity thieves, what
        was their solution? Two years of (Experian) credit monitoring for customers, and
        millions of dollars spent lobbying for CISA, a surveillance bill that would give
        them immunity for leaking private customer data, as long as they share it with the
        government.<!-- CISA creates no incentives for companies to actually
        improve their cybersecurity practices--> This security negligence has to stop.
        <!--They shouldn't be allowed to
        get off scot-free for their security negligence.--> It's time for the FTC to do
        its job
        and start fining companies who put their customers at risk. This will give companies
        an actual incentive to invest in network security, something CISA utterly fails at.

    <h2>CISA is the opposite of cybersecurity.</h2>
    <h3>Blanket immunity rewards security incompetence.</h3>
    <p>
        There are many ways a cybersecurity bill could protect us against foreign
        hackers. Congress could require government contractors to upgrade from outdated systems
        like Windows XP, or require companies to notify customers about security vulnerabilities
        if they can't be fixed within a reasonable amount of time. Basic security hygeine
        standards around storage of private user data could be established. Unfortunately
        CISA does none of these things, because government agencies and corporate lobbyists
        don't want to actually invest in network security.
        Instead, CISA lets companies get off the hook for the worst types of privacy
        violations, as long as they share data with the government.
    </p>
    <h3>Sharing data with the government puts us all at more risk.</h3>
    <p>
        CISA will put more private data in the hands of a staggeringly wide array of
        government agencies. Agencies like the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy
        or the IRS are not equipped to safeguard this data—in fact,
        <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/17/irs-breach-affected-2x-as-many-taxpayers-as-expected.html" target="_blank">all of</a>
        these
        <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/09/09/cyber-attacks-doe-energy/71929786/" target="_blank">agencies</a>
        have been

        How would giving more private sector data to the U.S.
        government protect our cybersecurity when these government agencies can't even protect the data they already have?

    <h3>The FTC already has authority to regulate cybersecurity.</h3>
    <p>
        Cyber attacks aren't magic and hackers aren't wizards. Many of the biggest
        breaches could have been prevented if companies employed basic operational security
        measures, but companies have too much data and they're not taking security seriously.
        The FTC has the legal authority to investigate privacy breaches and impose
        fines and sanctions on companies in cases of negligence. The government already does it
        for oil spills, why not cybersecurity breaches? If companies faced strict penalties for
        exposing customers to identity theft, they would actually invest in security. This alone
        would stop hackers more than CISA ever could.
