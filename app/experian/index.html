    <h1>Experian's security negligence put 15&nbsp;million people at risk of ID theft.<em>Now they're lobbying Congress to get off the hook.</em></h1>
    <p>
        Experian should have used basic security practices to protect your data; they didn't. Now, 15 million T-Mobile customers’ most sensitive data has been leaked, likely be sold to the highest bidder. Instead of improving their security and securing their networks, Experian is spending millions lobbying Congress to pass CISA, a bill that may give them total legal immunity when they get hacked, as long as they share your personal information with the government. If they get away with it, we’ll never be able to hold companies accountable when their negligence puts our safety and privacy at risk. We need to draw a line in the sand, right now.

    <h2>CEO Brian Cassin puts his profits above your safety by funding corruption.</h2>
    <p>
        Under Cassin's leadership, Experian has spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress
        through donations and Political Action Committees. They've pushed legislation that would
        <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/04/15/why-this-national-data-breach-notification-bill-has-privacy-advocates-worried/" target="_blank">weaken data breach notification regulations</a>.
        Their top recipients in the House of Representatives all voted in favor of
        <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1560">PCNA</a>,
        a spying bill that would allow them to share customer information with the
        government. And now they're supporting CISA, a bill that would
        <a href="https://www.decidethefuture.org" target="_blank">broadly allow them to violate their privacy agreements</a> with customers and get
        immunity for leaking peoples' information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Brian Cassin has put the profits of his company above the well-being of his customers.
        His strategy is simple&mdash;by giving enough money to politicians, those politicians
        will pass legislation allowing him to duck responsibility any time Experian's data
        get breached. Why bother improving their security when they can just
        buy politicians? This is textbook corruption, and this style of leadership should not
        be acceptable for any U.S. company.
    </p>
    <h3>What's wrong with CISA?</h3>
    <p>
        If Experian gets their way, they'll never have to be held responsible whenever
        they leak your data. CISA is a mass surveillance bill disguised as a "cybersecurity"
        bill, but it does nothing whatsoever to improve our nation's security:

    <ul class="copy">
        <li>
            All privacy policies effectively null and void. Companies can shareany
            private user data with the government, without a warrant, as long as
            the government says it is being used for a “cybersecurity” purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            Data is shared with a wide array of government agencies, from the FBI
            and NSA, to the IRS and local law enforcement. Many of these agencies
            have been breached within the last year.
        </li>
        <li>
            In exchange, companies are given blanket immunity from civil and criminal
            laws, like fraud, money laundering, or illegal wiretapping (if a
            violation was committed or exposed in the process of sharing data).
        </li>
        <li>
            Companies that play along can get otherwise classified intelligence data
            from the government, including private information about their competitors.
