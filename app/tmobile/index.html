    <h1>T-Mobile let millions of their customers get hacked. Are they now lobbying to get away with it?</em></h1>
    <p>
       T-Mobile put their customers at risk by trusting Experian to do credit checks for them despite that company’s well-documented history of over 100 data breaches. As a result, the names, addresses, birth dates, and Social Security numbers of 15 million T-Mobile customers are now available on the black market for identity thieves to purchase for $1 per file. But instead of looking at ways to fix their security issues, T-Mobile is waffling on a bill in Congress known as CISA that would ensure they are not liable for having poor security and getting hacked. Just this week they dropped out of a major trade association seemingly because the organization criticized the bill. That's no way to stand by your customers and their sensitive data.

            <h3>Ask T-Mobile: Will you stand up for your customers’ privacy and security and oppose CISA?</h3>
            <div id="petition">Supporting CISA is probably the most anti-consumer response T-Mobile could have to their recent hack. It would not only give them immunity for lax security, but would also make future hacks more likely and put more private communications information into the hands of the NSA and local law enforcement. T-Mobile says they take their customer’s privacy “VERY seriously.” But these hacks start with companies leaving the front door open. Instead of lobbying to make sure they don't have to take responsibility for poor data practices, they should focus on fixing their security. If they don’t come out against CISA and continue to make moves towards embracing it, no one should trust them. </div>

    <h3>But what's wrong with CISA?</h3>
    <p>
        CISA is not a real cybersecurity bill. It puts American citizens under more
        mass surveillance and opens up the doors to even more foreign cyber attacks.
        <ul><li>All privacy policies effectively null and void. Companies can share any private user data with the government, without a warrant, as long as the government says it is being used for a “cybersecurity” purpose.
<li>In exchange, companies are given blanket immunity from civil and criminal laws, like fraud, money laundering, or illegal wiretapping (if a violation was committed or exposed in the process of sharing data).</li>
<li>Data is shared with a wide array of government agencies, from the FBI and NSA, to the IRS and local law enforcement. Many of these agencies have been breached within the last year and have outdated security systems, opening up the doors to even more cyber attacks.</li>
<li>Companies that play along can get otherwise classified intelligence data from the government, including private information about their competitors.</li>
</ul>
